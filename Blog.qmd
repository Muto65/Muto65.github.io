Data analysis often goes beyond just crunching numbers—it's a story of discovery and visualization. This blog dives into Study 1, Study 2, and the development of an interactive dashboard, offering a window into how structured analyses and tools like Quarto and Shiny brought data to life.

## Study 1: Blood Pressure and Health Insights

## Research Focus

Study 1 explored systolic blood pressure readings to uncover variability between paired measurements. Using data from the NHANES 2017–March 2020 dataset, the aim was to identify trends, outliers, and potential biases between two oscillometric readings.

## Steps Undertaken

### Data Cleaning:

The dataset was filtered to ensure valid readings for both BPXOSY1 (first reading) and BPXOSY2 (second reading). Missing values and extreme outliers were removed.

### Descriptive Statistics:

Key metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and interquartile range were calculated. Histograms and boxplots provided a clear visualization of distribution differences.

### Statistical Testing:

A Wilcoxon signed-rank test assessed if the differences between BPXOSY1 and BPXOSY2 were statistically significant. Bootstrap confidence intervals validated the results.

### Key Findings:

Statistically significant differences between the two readings were observed, likely reflecting measurement variability or physiological changes during sessions.

#  Study 2: BMI, Smoking, and Education Insights 

## Research Focus 

Study 2 broadened the scope, investigating relationships between:

Body Mass Index (BMI) by Gender Smoking Status and Obesity Race and Education Levels

## Steps Undertaken 

### Data Cleaning:

Each variable of interest (e.g., BMI, Smoking, Education) was filtered to ensure completeness. BMI thresholds categorized participants as obese or non-obese, while education levels were stratified across racial groups.

#### Visualization and Analysis:

Gender vs. BMI:

Boxplots and density plots highlighted BMI distributions across genders. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed statistically significant differences between male and female BMI. Smoking and Obesity: Contingency tables were constructed for smoking status and obesity categories. A Chi-square test measured the association, with mosaic plots visualizing trends. Race and Education: A Chi-square test examined relationships between racial groups and educational attainment. Heatmaps of standardized residuals emphasized over- and under-representation in education levels across racial categories.

### Key Findings:

Significant gender differences in BMI were detected, with females having higher average BMI. No strong statistical association was found between smoking status and obesity. Racial disparities in education attainment were evident, with Non-Hispanic Asians being overrepresented in higher education.

### Interactive Dashboard: Bringing the Analyses to Life Purpose 

The dashboard provides an interactive interface for exploring the results from Study 1 and Study 2, enabling stakeholders to visualize trends dynamically and tailor insights to their needs.

# Building the Dashboard Tools Used:

Shiny for interactivity. R for backend data manipulation and visualization. Quarto for embedding the dashboard into a website. Dashboard Features:

Analysis Selection: Users choose between Blood Pressure, BMI, Smoking vs. Obesity, or Race vs. Education analyses.

### Dynamic Visualizations:

Scatter plots, boxplots, and bar charts update based on user inputs (e.g., gender, BMI ranges, race filters).

### Summary Tables: 

Key statistics for each analysis are displayed in a tabular format. Statistical Results: Outputs from tests like Wilcoxon rank-sum or Chi-square tests are presented for deeper insights.

## Deployment:

The app was deployed using ShinyApps.io. The interactive dashboard was then embedded into a Quarto website hosted on GitHub Pages.

Technical Challenges and Solutions:

-   Managing dependencies: Ensured all required libraries and datasets were properly installed and loaded.

-   Visual consistency: Fine-tuned plot dimensions and styling for a professional appearance.

-   Embedding in Quarto: Used an iframe to integrate the Shiny app seamlessly into the website.

# Bringing It All Together

By combining the rigor of statistical analyses with the flexibility of interactive dashboards, this project illustrates the power of data storytelling. Study 1 and Study 2 delved into vital health metrics, revealing significant patterns and relationships. The dashboard turned these findings into an engaging, user-centric tool that bridges the gap between raw data and actionable insights.

Whether you're an academic, policymaker, or health advocate, the Study 1 Dashboard invites you to explore and understand the data that shapes our health narratives. Visit the interactive dashboard or explore the full analyses on the Quarto website.

This blog serves as a testament to the role of data science in unraveling complex stories and making them accessible to everyone. Stay tuned for future updates and explorations!
