Welcome to my blog! This post introduces the **Study1 Dashboard**, a comprehensive and interactive tool designed to explore hypotheses, visualize data, and test statistical models. This dashboard was inspired by a desire to simplify data analysis while making the results accessible to both experts and non-experts.

In this post, I’ll walk you through the process of building the dashboard, the hypotheses tested, the types of analyses performed, and the key findings. Along the way, I’ll share my reflections and challenges faced during the development processStudy 1: Blood Pressure and Health Insights

## Conceptualizing the Dashboard

The goal was to create an interactive environment where users could dynamically filter data, visualize relationships, and view statistical results for specific hypotheses. The dataset used came from the 2018-March 2020 NHANES survey, focusing on metrics such as **blood pressure**, **body mass index (BMI)**, **smoking status**, **Race**, **Gender** and **education levels**.

### Hypotheses Tested
Is there a significant difference between the first and second systolic blood pressure measurements?
How does BMI vary by gender?
Is there an association between smoking status and obesity?
What is the relationship between race/ethnicity and education levels?

### Analysis that a user can perform
#### Blood Pressure Analysis
Using the paired systolic blood pressure readings, we tested for differences using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, a non-parametric method, given the lack of normality. Scatter plots and Paired boxplots were used to compare the first and secend systolic blood pressure and observed significant differences, indicating high variability in measurements and users can visualize the statistical summeries using the drop down from our interactive dashboard to visualize the data sumarries, association plots and statistical test results. 

#### BMI and Gender Analysis
We tested whether BMI differs significantly between males and females using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, users can select a arrange of BMI values ranging from 15 to 50 and the look at the statistical variations within this range and as well as assessing the differences in mean BMI between the two genders, Users can also interactively visualize the  data distribution changes using Boxplots, density plots from the dashboard tab.A key finding that one can observe is that Females had a statistically significantly higher average BMI than males.

#### Smoking and Obesity
Using our interactive dashboard, user can also interrogate the relationship Smoking Status and obesity by using the drop down, and explore data summaries, test statistic results, plots. 
A key findings was that we did not observe a statistically significant association between smoking and obesity.

#### Race and Education Levels
To investigate relationships between race and education levels, we used Chi-Square Test of Independence and evaluated whether these variables were dependent.Through our interactive dashboard, one can explore the education distribution across the race/ethnicity using Bar plots for example, we can compute data summaries for each education level within the test dataset. 
A notable finding is that there were statistically significant differences for example, non-Hispanic Asians were overrepresented at higher education levels and Mexican Americans were overrepresented at lower education levels. 
#### Results and Conclusions
Our Interactive Dashboard provided actionable insights across multiple hypotheses. The findings align with broader public health trends, such as disparities in education levels and gender-based differences in BMI. However, certain analyses (e.g., smoking and obesity) suggested null results, encouraging further exploration with additional confounders.

#### Reflections
This was both a technical and intellectual challenge. It provided me with an opportunity to integrate statistical rigor with user-centric design. As a next step, I plan to extend the dashboard to include predictive modeling and longitudinal data analysis.

### Dashboard Design steps
The dashboard was built using Shiny in R and deployed using shinyapp.io. It was designed in such away that it enables users to customize analyses using dropdwons and toggles to filter subsets of data for the analyses they are interested in. Each hypothesis was supported by intuitive visualizations including scatter plots, bar charts, and boxplots, with test results such as p-values and confidence intervals and data summaries displayed in real-time. The dashboard was then integrated into my  Quarto-based website hosted on Github pages.
