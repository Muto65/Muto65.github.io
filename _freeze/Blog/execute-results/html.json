This post introduces the **MyNHANESDashboard**, a comprehensive and interactive tool designed to explore hypotheses, visualize data, and test statistical models. This dashboard was inspired by a desire to simplify data analysis while making the results accessible to both experts and non-experts.\n\nIn this post, I’ll walk you through the process of building the dashboard, the hypotheses tested, the types of analyses performed, and the key findings. Along the way, I’ll share my reflections and challenges faced during the development process.\n\n## 1. Conceptualizing the Dashboard\n\nThe **MyNHANESDashboard** was designed to provide an interactive environment where users can dynamically filter data, visualize relationships, and view statistical results for specific hypotheses. Using data from the 2017-March 2020 NHANES survey, we focused on key metrics including blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, race, gender, and education levels.\n\nThe aim was to enable users to:\n\n-   Explore trends and relationships in the data.\n\n-   Test hypotheses using statistical methods.\n\n-   Visualize results interactively.\n\n### 1.1.

Hypotheses Tested\n\nThe following hypotheses were central to the dashboard's functionality:\n\n1.  Is there a significant difference between the first and second systolic blood pressure measurements?\n\n2.  How does BMI vary by gender?\n\n3.  Is there an association between smoking status and obesity?\n\n4.  What is the relationship between race/ethnicity and education levels?\n\n## 3. Analysis that a user can perform\n\n### 3.1 Blood Pressure Analysis\n\nUsing the paired systolic blood pressure readings, we tested for differences using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, a non-parametric method, given the lack of normality. Scatter plots and Paired boxplots were used to compare the first and second systolic blood pressure and observed significant differences, indicating high variability in measurements and users can visualize the statistical summaries using the drop down from our interactive dashboard to visualize the data summaries, association plots and statistical test results.\n\n### 3.2. BMI and Gender Analysis\n\nWe tested whether BMI differs significantly between males and females using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, users can select a arrange of BMI values ranging from 15 to 50 and the look at the statistical variations within this range and as well as assessing the differences in mean BMI between the two genders, Users can also interactively visualize the data distribution changes using Box plots, density plots from the dashboard tab.A key finding that one can observe is that Females had a statistically significantly higher average BMI than males.\n\n### 3.3. Smoking and Obesity\n\nUsing our interactive dashboard, user can also interrogate the relationship Smoking Status and obesity by using the drop down, and explore data summaries, test statistic results, plots. A key findings was that we did not observe a statistically significant association between smoking and obesity.\n\n### 3.4. Race and Education Levels\n\nTo investigate relationships between race and education levels, we used Chi-Square Test of Independence and evaluated whether these variables were dependent.Through our interactive dashboard, one can explore the education distribution across the race/ethnicity using Bar plots for example, we can compute data summaries for each education level within the test dataset. A notable finding is that there were statistically significant differences for example, non-Hispanic Asians were overrepresented at higher education levels and Mexican Americans were overrepresented at lower education levels.\n\n## 4. Results and Conclusions\n\nThe **MyNHANESDashboard** successfully provided actionable insights into multiple hypotheses, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for exploring socio-demographic and health-related data. By integrating dynamic filtering, intuitive visualizations, and robust statistical analyses, the dashboard allowed users to identify significant patterns and relationships across various metrics.\n\nKey findings highlighted broader public health trends:\n\n-   **Disparities in Education Levels**: Analysis revealed significant associations between race/ethnicity and education levels, reflecting known disparities. For instance, non-Hispanic Asians were overrepresented in higher education levels, while Mexican Americans showed higher representation at lower education levels. These findings align with socioeconomic trends observed in public health literature and underscore the importance of addressing educational inequities as a social determinant of health.\n\n-   **Gender-Based Differences in BMI**: The analysis confirmed a statistically significant difference in BMI between males and females, with females exhibiting higher average BMI. This observation aligns with established research suggesting differences in body composition, lifestyle factors, and hormonal influences between genders.\n\nWhile some hypotheses yielded clear results, others produced null findings that invite further exploration:\n\n-   **Smoking and Obesity**: No statistically significant association was observed between smoking status and obesity. While this may suggest a lack of direct correlation in the NHANES dataset, it also highlights the need to examine additional confounding factors, such as physical activity levels, dietary habits, and socioeconomic status, which could mediate or mask potential relationships.\n\nThe dashboard not only confirmed expected trends but also served as a springboard for deeper inquiry. For example, null findings in the smoking-obesity analysis point to potential limitations in the dataset or the complexity of interactions between behavioral and physiological factors. These results emphasize the need for multifaceted approaches in public health research to fully understand these relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, the **MyNHANESDashboard** demonstrated its utility as an interactive platform for hypothesis testing, offering both clarity and depth in its analyses. Its findings provide a foundation for future studies, particularly in areas where trends and null results warrant further exploration. By equipping users with the ability to explore relationships dynamically, the dashboard bridges the gap between data complexity and actionable insights, paving the way for informed decision-making in public health and beyond.\n\n## 5. Dashboard Design steps\n\n### 5.1. Define Objectives and Data Needs\n\nThe design process began with identifying key focus areas for analysis, which included blood pressure comparisons, BMI differences, smoking-obesity relationships, and race-education associations. These focus areas informed the selection of datasets from the NHANES survey. The datasets were pre-processed and stored in `.rds` files to facilitate efficient integration into the dashboard.\n\n### 5.2. Select Libraries\n\nTo support the dashboard's functionality, several libraries were chosen for their specific capabilities. Core libraries included `shiny` for creating interactivity, `tidyverse` for data manipulation, and `DT` for displaying interactive tables. For visualization, `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, and `gridExtra` were employed to create custom, multi-panel plots. Statistical analysis was conducted using `broom`, `boot`, and `epitools`, ensuring the inclusion of robust testing and diagnostics.\n\n### 5.3. User Interface Design\n\nThe dashboard was structured with a clear and intuitive layout to enhance usability. The **Sidebar Panel** featured drop down menus and sliders that allowed users to dynamically filter data and customize their analyses. Conditional inputs were employed to display relevant options based on the selected analysis type. The **Main Panel** was organized into tabs, enabling users to seamlessly navigate between summary tables, plots, statistical results, and datasets.\n\n### 5.4. Server Logic\n\nReactive programming formed the backbone of the server logic, enabling the dashboard to dynamically filter and process data based on user inputs. Outputs were customized for each analysis type:\n\n-   Visualizations included scatter plots, boxplots, and bar charts tailored to specific data relationships.\n\n-   Statistical tests provided real-time outputs, such as p-values and confidence intervals.\n\n-   Interactive tables allowed users to explore both raw and filtered datasets.\n\n### 5.5. Enhanced Usability\n\nTo further enhance the user experience, conditional UI elements ensured that users were only presented with options relevant to their selected analysis. Multi-panel visualizations were utilized to clearly illustrate relationships between variables, making complex data relationships easier to understand.\n\n### 5.6. Deployment and Integration\n\nThe dashboard was deployed using ShinyApps.io, providing broad accessibility to users. Additionally, it was integrated into a Quarto-based website hosted on GitHub Pages. This integration ensured seamless updates and sharing, enabling users to interact with the dashboard within a broader context of documentation and analysis results.\n\n## 6. Reflections\n\nThis was both a technical and intellectual challenge. It provided me with an opportunity to integrate statistical rigor with user-centric design. As a next step, I plan to extend the dashboard to include predictive modeling and longitudinal data analysis.\n",
