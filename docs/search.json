    "text": "4. Analysis A\n4.1. Research Question\n4.1.1.Problem statement\nResearch has shown that systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a critical measure for diagnosing hypertension and assessing cardiovascular risk. Repeated measurements are usually taken to improve accuracy and account for variability caused by circumstances such as white coat hypertension (temporary rise in blood pressure due to clinical environment), measurement error or technical variability and physiological changes during the measurement process. And therefore understanding the consistency or difference between successive SBP measurements can inform the protocol used for measuring blood pressure by highlighting any systematic bias in measurements and also help in identifying persons who at a risk of developing hypertension.\n4.1.2. Research Question:\nIs there a significant difference between the first and second oscillometric systolic blood pressure measurements (BPXOSY1 and BPXOSY2) in individuals as recorded in the NHANES 2017–March 2020 dataset?.\n4.1.3. Hypotheses\n4.1.3.1 Null Hypothesis \\(({H_o})\\)\n\nThere is no significant difference between the mean of the first systolic blood pressure measurement (BPXOSY1) and the second systolic blood pressure measurement (BPXOSY2)\n\\[{H_o} : {μ_{BPXOSY1} = μ_{BPXOSY2}}\\]\n4.1.3.2. Alternative Hypothesis\nThere is a significant difference between the mean of the first systolic blood pressure measurement (BPXOSY1) and the second systolic blood pressure measurement (BPXOSY2).\n\\[{H_A} : {μ_{BPXOSY1}  \\neq  μ_{BPXOSY2}}\\]\n4.2.

Main Analysis\nHere, I used Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test to compare the means of the systolic blood pressure between the two sessions since the data did not meet the normality requirements.

Conclusions\nFrom the results of the Wilcoxon signed rank, We observe that The p-value is very small (0.004), which is far below the common significance level (α=0.05), which implies that the true median difference between Systolic blood pressure values for the 2 oscillometric readings is not equal to zero. And hence there is a statistically significant difference in the paired samples (BPXOSY1 and BPXOSY2). The bootstrap analysis further confirms that there is a significant difference between the paired samples. The mean difference is estimated to be between 0.0005 and 0.0028 with 95% confidence, which is above zero. This supports the conclusion that the two paired systolic blood pressure are statistically different."

Main Analysis\nFrom the histogram and the Q-Q Normal plot, we observe that Body Mass index is right skewed and hence does not satisfy the normality requirement and hence in the subsequent analyses, I will use non parametric methods such as Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Bootstrap for calculating the confidence intervals.\n5.3.1.

Conclusions\nThe mean BMI for males was 29.571(sd = 6.631), and the mean BMI for females was 30.858 (sd = 8.493). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicated that there is a significant difference between mean BM1 between males and females (p &lt;0.05). Bootstrap resampling provided a confidence interval of [-1.607, -1.012], since the confidence bounds lie below 0 and are both negative indicate that the male group has a significantly lower mean than the female group."

Problem Statement\nSmoking and obesity are two significant risk factors for numerous chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and certain cancers. Investigating the relationship between these two factors is essential to understand whether smoking status (current smoker vs. non-smoker) is associated with obesity status (obese vs. non-obese). By dividing the population into four distinct groups based on these binary categorical variables, we aim to assess the interaction between smoking and obesity and evaluate any potential public health implications.\n6.1.2.

Describing The Data\nRefer to the codebook in section 3 for the description of the variable SMQ020 and Body Mass Index (BMXBMI). However, for this analysis BMI was converted into a binary variable with people having BMI &gt; 30 considered to be obese and those with BMI &lt; 30 considered non-obese and as earlier described smoking was binarized into non-smoker and smoker. Here, I ran a data exploratory analysis and described the distribution of each of the two variables by looking at their statistical summaries, 2x2 table and continued to provide some visualization graphics including bar plot, mosaic plot, and boxplots to provide a better understanding of the data.\n6.2.1.

This implies that smokers have 6.06% higher odds of being obese compared to non-smokers. The confidence interval includes 1, indicating no statistical significance. The conditional maximum likelihood estimate odds ratio (MLE Odds Ratio) is 1.0605 (90%CI:0.9755,1.1531). This is consistent with the sample Odds Ratio, confirming that there is no statistically significant association.\nAdditionally, the absolute difference in probability of being obese between smokers and non-smokers is 0.0145(90%CI: -0.0058,0.0348), which highlights that smokers have a 1.68% higher probability of being obese compared to non-smokers. Further highlighting that there is no statistically significant association between smoking status and obesity as is also t indicated by exact p-value (p =0.2404) and asymptotic p-value (p=0.2491) being greater than 0.05 and the chi-square test (p=0.149).\n6.4. Conclusions.\nFrom the statistical analysis test conducted under this test analysis, we did not observe a statistically significant association between smoking status and obesity. However, this association may be influenced by other confounding factors such as lifestyle, physical activity, diet and other socio-economic factors."

Research Question\nIs there a statistically significant relationship between race/ethnicity and education level in the NHANES population using a statistical analysis of a contingency table?\n7.1.2. Problem Statement\nUnderstanding the relationship between race/ethnicity and education level is critical for addressing systemic disparities in access to educational opportunities. Education level is a key determinant of socioeconomic status, health outcomes, and overall quality of life. Similarly, race and ethnicity often intersect with structural barriers that shape access to education. Examining this relationship can provide insights into equity gaps and inform policy interventions.\n7.1.3. Hypothesis\n7.1.3.1. Null Hypothesis \\(({H_0})\\):\nThere is no association between race/ethnicity and education level in the population represented by the 2017-March 2020 NHANES population data. The observed frequencies in the J x K table are consistent with what would be expected if the variables were independent.\n\n7.1.3.2. Alternative Hypothesis \\(({H_A})\\):\nThere is an association between race/ethnicity and education level in the population. The observed frequencies in the J x K table deviate significantly from what would be expected under the assumptions of independence.\n7.2. Describing The Data\nThe data used for this analysis has been described in the codebook in section 3. However, this analysis unravels the association between two categorical variables of race/ethnicity and education level in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 population data set. Race/ethnicity is a categorical variable with 5 levels including Mexican, Hispanic, White, Black and American re-coded from the 6 levels originally present in the RIDRETH3 variable whereas Education level is also a categorical variable with 5 levels too, which have been re-coded to less_9th grade, 9_12th_grade, High_school, Some_college, and College_graduate, describing the 5 of the 6 levels of the original ‘DMDEDUC2’ variable in the 2017-March 2020 NHANES dataset.\n\n7.2.1.

Non-Hispanic Asians are under shown to be less represented at lower education levels suggesting they are less likely to fall into the lower education category whereas Mexican American and Other Hispanic groups vary, but with significant deviations in some education levels highlighting over-representation or underrepresentation.\n7.4. Conclusions\nThese findings suggest that there is a significant relationship between race/ethnicity and education levels, which supports for further exploration of the systemic or cultural factors driving these disparities."

Assessing Assumptions\nTo check whether the fitted models meets the linearity assumption, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity, and influential points, I extracted the residuals and their fitted values to plot the ‘Residuals vs. Fitted Plot’, normality Q-Q plot, Scale-location plot, and the residuals vs. leverage plot as shown below.\n9.3.1. Residuals vs. Fitted plot\n\n# Residuals for Big and Small Models\nResidual_Big &lt;- augment(big_model)\nResidual_Small &lt;- augment(small_model)\n\n# Residual plots\np1 &lt;- ggplot(Residual_Big)+ geom_point(aes(x =.fitted, y =.resid),color = \"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title = \"Residuals vs. Predicted (Big Model)\",\n       x = \"Predicted BMI (Big Model)\",\n       y = \"Residuals\") +  theme_classic(base_size = 8) +\ntheme(\n        axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = 10),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 12))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(Residual_Small) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = .fitted, y = .resid), color = \"green\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  labs(title = \"Residuals vs. Predicted (Small Model)\",\n       x = \"Predicted BMI (Small Model)\",\n       y = \"Residuals\") + theme_classic(base_size = 8) +\n theme(\n        axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = 10),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 12))\n\np1+p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the residuals vs. predicted plots above, the Big model shows more evenly distributed residuals around the zero line, suggesting it. captures the variance in the data better and meets the homoscedasticity assumption, whereas on the other hand, the small model has residuals clustered at specific predicted values, indicating poor fit and limited variability in its predictions, reflecting the oversimplification of using only gender as a predictor.\n9.3.2. Q-Q Plot\nThis plot assesses normality of residuals by comparing them to a thretical normal distribution.\n\n# Big Model Q-Q Plot\np1 &lt;- ggplot(Residual_Big, aes(sample = .resid)) +\n  stat_qq(color = \"blue\") +\n  stat_qq_line(color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Q-Q Plot (Big Model)\",\n       x = \"Theoretical Quantiles\",\n       y = \"Sample Quantiles\") +  theme_classic(base_size = 8) +\n  theme(\n        axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = 10),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 12))\n\n# Small Model Q-Q Plot\n p2 &lt;- ggplot(Residual_Small, aes(sample = .resid)) +\n  stat_qq(color = \"green\") +\n  stat_qq_line(color = \"red\") +\n  labs(title = \"Q-Q Plot (Small Model)\",\n       x = \"Theoretical Quantiles\",\n       y = \"Sample Quantiles\") +  theme_classic(base_size = 8) +\n  theme(\n        axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = 10),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 12))\n\n p1+p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the q-Q plot, we observed that for the small Model, the residuals more closely to the theoretical quantile line,suggesting better adherence to the normality assumption, implying a better fit, whereas the big model show deviation from the theoretical quantile line, particularly at the extremes, suggesting a lack of normality in the residuals, highlighting the presence of potential outliers affecting the distribution.\n9.3.3. Scale-Location Plot\nHere, we plot the square root of the standardized residuals to assess constant variance\n\n# Big Model Scale-Location Plot\n#Residual_Big$Std_Residuals &lt;- sqrt(abs(scale(big_model_residuals$Residuals)))\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(Residual_Big, aes(x = .fitted, y = .std.resid)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Scale-Location Plot (Big Model)\",\n       x = \"Fitted Values\",\n       y = \"√|Standardized Residuals|\") +  theme_classic(base_size = 8) +\n theme(\n        axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = 10),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 12))\n\n# Small Model Scale-Location Plot\n#small_model_residuals$Std_Residuals &lt;- sqrt(abs(scale(small_model_residuals$Residuals)))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(Residual_Small, aes(x = .fitted, y = .std.resid)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"green\", alpha = 0.6) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"loess\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n  labs(title = \"Scale-Location Plot (Small Model)\",\n       x = \"Fitted Values\",\n       y = \"√|Standardized Residuals|\") +  theme_classic(base_size = 8) +\n theme(\n        axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = 10),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 12))\np1+p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Scale-Laction plot for the big model(left) indicates heteroscedasticity, as the spread of residuals varies with fitted values, and the red trendline is not flat, suggesting non-constant variance. Conversely, the small model (right) shows a consistent spread of residuals around the red line, indicating more uniform variance but limited variability in fitted values. These results suggest that while the small model has a simpler structure, the Big Model may suffer from issues related to over-fitting.\n9.3.4. Residuals vs. Leverage Plot\n\n# Big Model Residuals vs Leverage\nbig_model_influence &lt;- data.frame(\n  Leverage = hatvalues(big_model),\n  Residuals = resid(big_model),\n  Cooks_Distance = cooks.distance(big_model)\n)\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(big_model_influence, aes(x = Leverage, y = Residuals, size = Cooks_Distance)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = \"blue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  scale_size_continuous(name = \"Cook's Distance\") +\n  labs(title = \"Residuals vs Leverage (Big Model)\",\n       x = \"Leverage\",\n       y = \"Residuals\") +  theme_classic(base_size = 8) +\n theme(\n        axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = 10),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 12))\n\n# Small Model Residuals vs Leverage\nsmall_model_influence &lt;- data.frame(\n  Leverage = hatvalues(small_model),\n  Residuals = resid(small_model),\n  Cooks_Distance = cooks.distance(small_model)\n)\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(small_model_influence, aes(x = Leverage, y = Residuals, size = Cooks_Distance)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = \"green\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"red\") +\n  scale_size_continuous(name = \"Cook's Distance\") +\n  labs(title = \"Residuals vs Leverage (Small Model)\",\n       x = \"Leverage\",\n       y = \"Residuals\") +  theme_classic(base_size = 8) +\n  theme(\n        axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\",size = 10),\n        axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 12))\np1+p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Residuals vs Leverage plot for the Big Model shows a wide spread of residuals with varying leverage values, indicating potential influential poitns that could disproportionately impact the model’s fit. Cook’s Distance circles suggest the presence of points with moderate influence, though none appear to be extreme outliers. In contrast, the small model demonstrates a more clustered pattern of residuals and leverage, with minimal influential points, reflecting its simplicity and robustness against leverage but potentially lacking complexity to capture variability."

BMI thresholds categorized participants as obese or non-obese, while education levels were stratified across racial groups.\n\nVisualization and Analysis:\nGender vs. BMI:\nBoxplots and density plots highlighted BMI distributions across genders. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed statistically significant differences between male and female BMI. Smoking and Obesity: Contingency tables were constructed for smoking status and obesity categories. A Chi-square test measured the association, with mosaic plots visualizing trends. Race and Education: A Chi-square test examined relationships between racial groups and educational attainment. Heatmaps of standardized residuals emphasized over- and under-representation in education levels across racial categories.\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\nSignificant gender differences in BMI were detected, with females having higher average BMI. No strong statistical association was found between smoking status and obesity. Racial disparities in education attainment were evident, with Non-Hispanic Asians being overrepresented in higher education.\n\n\nInteractive Dashboard: Bringing the Analyses to Life Purpose\nThe dashboard provides an interactive interface for exploring the results from Study 1 and Study 2, enabling stakeholders to visualize trends dynamically and tailor insights to their needs."

    "text": "2.1. Identify a Quantitative outcome\nThe qualitative outcome of this analysis is Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is often used as an indicator for assessing body fat based on height and weight and is also quiet associated with an individual’s quality of life.BMI data to be used for this analysis was corrected from participants from the 2017-March 2020 NHANES survey and was recorded as BMXBMI. ## 2.2. Identify key predictor and three other predictors of outcome\nThe key predictor for this analysis is Gender. Quite often gender physiological differences between people of different sex prevail and these may result in differences in BMI due to biological, hormonal, and societal factors influencing body composition, metabolism, lifestyle behaviors among others. Understanding how BMI varies with gender within a population and how this relationship may be affected by other cofounding factors including age, smoking status, and race may provide us with insights on how this association may influence the gender based health outcomes within the United States population."

    "text": "3. Analysis that a user can perform\n3.1 Blood Pressure Analysis\nUsing the paired systolic blood pressure readings, we tested for differences using Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, a non-parametric method, given the lack of normality. Scatter plots and Paired boxplots were used to compare the first and second systolic blood pressure and observed significant differences, indicating high variability in measurements and users can visualize the statistical summaries using the drop down from our interactive dashboard to visualize the data summaries, association plots and statistical test results.\n3.2. BMI and Gender Analysis\nWe tested whether BMI differs significantly between males and females using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum Test, users can select a arrange of BMI values ranging from 15 to 50 and the look at the statistical variations within this range and as well as assessing the differences in mean BMI between the two genders, Users can also interactively visualize the data distribution changes using Box plots, density plots from the dashboard tab.A key finding that one can observe is that Females had a statistically significantly higher average BMI than males.\n3.3. Smoking and Obesity\nUsing our interactive dashboard, user can also interrogate the relationship Smoking Status and obesity by using the drop down, and explore data summaries, test statistic results, plots. A key findings was that we did not observe a statistically significant association between smoking and obesity.\n3.4. Race and Education Levels\nTo investigate relationships between race and education levels, we used Chi-Square Test of Independence and evaluated whether these variables were dependent.Through our interactive dashboard, one can explore the education distribution across the race/ethnicity using Bar plots for example, we can compute data summaries for each education level within the test dataset. A notable finding is that there were statistically significant differences for example, non-Hispanic Asians were overrepresented at higher education levels and Mexican Americans were overrepresented at lower education levels."

    "text": "4. Results and Conclusions\nThe MyNHANESDashboard successfully provided actionable insights into multiple hypotheses, demonstrating its potential as a valuable tool for exploring socio-demographic and health-related data. By integrating dynamic filtering, intuitive visualizations, and robust statistical analyses, the dashboard allowed users to identify significant patterns and relationships across various metrics.\nKey findings highlighted broader public health trends:\n\nDisparities in Education Levels: Analysis revealed significant associations between race/ethnicity and education levels, reflecting known disparities. For instance, non-Hispanic Asians were overrepresented in higher education levels, while Mexican Americans showed higher representation at lower education levels. These findings align with socioeconomic trends observed in public health literature and underscore the importance of addressing educational inequities as a social determinant of health.\nGender-Based Differences in BMI: The analysis confirmed a statistically significant difference in BMI between males and females, with females exhibiting higher average BMI. This observation aligns with established research suggesting differences in body composition, lifestyle factors, and hormonal influences between genders.\n\nWhile some hypotheses yielded clear results, others produced null findings that invite further exploration:\n\n\nSmoking and Obesity: No statistically significant association was observed between smoking status and obesity. While this may suggest a lack of direct correlation in the NHANES dataset, it also highlights the need to examine additional confounding factors, such as physical activity levels, dietary habits, and socioeconomic status, which could mediate or mask potential relationships.\n\nThe dashboard not only confirmed expected trends but also served as a springboard for deeper inquiry. For example, null findings in the smoking-obesity analysis point to potential limitations in the dataset or the complexity of interactions between behavioral and physiological factors. These results emphasize the need for multifaceted approaches in public health research to fully understand these relationships.\nIn conclusion, the MyNHANESDashboard demonstrated its utility as an interactive platform for hypothesis testing, offering both clarity and depth in its analyses. Its findings provide a foundation for future studies, particularly in areas where trends and null results warrant further exploration. By equipping users with the ability to explore relationships dynamically, the dashboard bridges the gap between data complexity and actionable insights, paving the way for informed decision-making in public health and beyond."

    "text": "5. Dashboard Design steps\n5.1. Define Objectives and Data Needs\nThe design process began with identifying key focus areas for analysis, which included blood pressure comparisons, BMI differences, smoking-obesity relationships, and race-education associations. These focus areas informed the selection of datasets from the NHANES survey. The datasets were pre-processed and stored in .rds files to facilitate efficient integration into the dashboard.\n5.2. Select Libraries\nTo support the dashboard’s functionality, several libraries were chosen for their specific capabilities. Core libraries included shiny for creating interactivity, tidyverse for data manipulation, and DT for displaying interactive tables. For visualization, ggplot2, patchwork, and gridExtra were employed to create custom, multi-panel plots. Statistical analysis was conducted using broom, boot, and epitools, ensuring the inclusion of robust testing and diagnostics.\n5.3. User Interface Design\nThe dashboard was structured with a clear and intuitive layout to enhance usability. The Sidebar Panel featured drop down menus and sliders that allowed users to dynamically filter data and customize their analyses. Conditional inputs were employed to display relevant options based on the selected analysis type. The Main Panel was organized into tabs, enabling users to seamlessly navigate between summary tables, plots, statistical results, and datasets.\n5.4. Server Logic\nReactive programming formed the backbone of the server logic, enabling the dashboard to dynamically filter and process data based on user inputs. Outputs were customized for each analysis type:\n\nVisualizations included scatter plots, boxplots, and bar charts tailored to specific data relationships.\nStatistical tests provided real-time outputs, such as p-values and confidence intervals.\nInteractive tables allowed users to explore both raw and filtered datasets.\n5.5. Enhanced Usability\nTo further enhance the user experience, conditional UI elements ensured that users were only presented with options relevant to their selected analysis. Multi-panel visualizations were utilized to clearly illustrate relationships between variables, making complex data relationships easier to understand.\n5.6. Deployment and Integration\nThe dashboard was deployed using ShinyApps.io, providing broad accessibility to users. Additionally, it was integrated into a Quarto-based website hosted on GitHub Pages. This integration ensured seamless updates and sharing, enabling users to interact with the dashboard within a broader context of documentation and analysis results."
