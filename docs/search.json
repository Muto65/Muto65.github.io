    "text": "4. Analysis A\n\n4.1. Research Question\n\n4.1.1.Problem statement\nResearch has shown that systolic blood pressure (SBP) is a critical measure for diagnosing hypertension and assessing cardiovascular risk. Repeated measurements are usually taken to improve accuracy and account for variability caused by circumstances such as white coat hypertension (temporary rise in blood pressure due to clinical environment), measurement error or technical variability and physiological changes during the measurement process. And therefore understanding the consistency or difference between successive SBP measurements can inform the protocol used for measuring blood pressure by highlighting any systematic bias in measurements and also help in identifying persons who at a risk of developing hypertension.\n\n\n4.1.2. Research Question:\nIs there a significant difference between the first and second oscillometric systolic blood pressure measurements (BPXOSY1 and BPXOSY2) in individuals as recorded in the NHANES 2017–March 2020 dataset?.\n\n\n4.1.3. Hypotheses\n\n4.1.3.1 Null Hypothesis \\(({H_o})\\)\nThere is no significant difference between the mean of the first systolic blood pressure measurement (BPXOSY1) and the second systolic blood pressure measurement (BPXOSY2)\n\\[{H_o} : {μ_{BPXOSY1} = μ_{BPXOSY2}}\\]\n\n\n4.1.3.2. Alternative Hypothesis\nThere is a significant difference between the mean of the first systolic blood pressure measurement (BPXOSY1) and the second systolic blood pressure measurement (BPXOSY2).\n\\[{H_A} : {μ_{BPXOSY1}  \\neq  μ_{BPXOSY2}}\\]\n\n\n\n\n4.2. Describing The Data\nRefer to the codebook in section 3 for the description of the variables (BPXOSY1 and BPXOSY2) used in this analysis. Here, I ran a data exploratory analysis and described the distribution of each of the two variables by looking at their statistical summaries (mean, median, sd, interquartile range, minimum, and maximum) and continued to provide some visualization graphics including histogram, boxplots, and Q-Q plots to provide a better understanding of the data.\n\nanalysisA_data &lt;- readRDS('data/AnalysisA.rds')# read the\nsummary(analysisA_data %&gt;% select(BPXOSY1,BPXOSY2))\n\n    BPXOSY1         BPXOSY2     \n Min.   : 66.0   Min.   : 69.0  \n 1st Qu.:111.0   1st Qu.:111.0  \n Median :121.0   Median :121.0  \n Mean   :124.3   Mean   :124.1  \n 3rd Qu.:135.0   3rd Qu.:135.0  \n Max.   :225.0   Max.   :222.0  \n\n\n\n4.2.1.

Conclusions\nFrom the results of the Wilcoxon signed rank, We observe that The p-value is very small (0.009), which is far below the common significance level (α=0.05), which implies that the true median difference between Systolic blood pressure values for the 2 oscillometric readings is not equal to zero. And hence there is a statistically significant difference in the paired samples (BPXOSY1 and BPXOSY2). The bootstrap analysis further confirms that there is a significant difference between the paired samples. The mean difference is estimated to be between 0.0004 and 0.0026 with 95% confidence, which is above zero. This supports the conclusion that the two paired systolic blood pressure are statistically different."

The Wilcoxon rank-sum test indicated that there is a significant difference between mean BM1 between males and females (p &lt;0.05). Bootstrap resampling provided a confidence interval of [-1.555, -1.014], since the confidence bounds lie below 0 and are both negative indicate that the male group has a significantly lower mean than the female group."

This implies that smokers have 7.05% higher odds of being obese compared to non-smokers. The confidence interval includes 1, indicating no statistical significance. The conditional maximum likelihood estimate odds ratio (MLE Odds Ratio) is 1.0705 (90%CI:0.9907,1.1568). This is consistent with the sample Odds Ratio, confirming that there is no statistically significant association.\nAdditionally, the absolute difference in probability of being obese between smokers and non-smokers is 0.0168(90%CI: -0.002,0.0356), which highlights that smokers have a 1.68% higher probability of being obese compared to non-smokers. Further highlighting that there is no statistically significant association between smoking status and obesity as is also t indicated by exact p-value (p =0.1431) and asymptotic p-value (p=0.1424) being greater than 0.05 and the chi-square test (p=0.149).\n\n\n\n6.4. Conclusions.\nFrom the statistical analysis test conducted under this test analysis, we did not observe a statistically significant association between smoking status and obesity. However, this association may be influenced by other confounding factors such as lifestyle, physical activity, diet and other socio-economic factors."

    "text": "7. Analysis E\n\n7.1. Question\n\n7.1.1. Research Question\nIs there a statistically significant relationship between race/ethnicity and education level in the NHANES population using a statistical analysis of a contingency table?\n\n\n7.1.2. Problem Statement\nUnderstanding the relationship between race/ethnicity and education level is critical for addressing systemic disparities in access to educational opportunities. Education level is a key determinant of socioeconomic status, health outcomes, and overall quality of life. Similarly, race and ethnicity often intersect with structural barriers that shape access to education. Examining this relationship can provide insights into equity gaps and inform policy interventions.\n\n\n7.1.3. Hypothesis\n\n7.1.3.1. Null Hypothesis \\(({H_0})\\):\nThere is no association between race/ethnicity and education level in the population represented by the 2017-March 2020 NHANES population data. The observed frequencies in the J x K table are consistent with what would be expected if the variables were independent.\n\n\n7.1.3.2. Alternative Hypothesis \\(({H_A})\\):\nThere is an association between race/ethnicity and education level in the population. The observed frequencies in the J x K table deviate significantly from what would be expected under the assumptions of independence.\n\n\n\n\n7.2. Describing The Data\nThe data used for this analysis has been described in the codebook in section 3. However, this analysis unravels the association between two categorical variables of race/ethnicity and education level in the NHANES 2017-March 2020 population data set. Race/ethnicity is a categorical variable with 5 levels including Mexican, Hispanic, White, Black and American re-coded from the 6 levels originally present in the RIDRETH3 variable whereas Education level is also a categorical variable with 5 levels too, which have been re-coded to less_9th grade, 9_12th_grade, High_school, Some_college, and College_graduate, describing the 5 of the 6 levels of the original ‘DMDEDUC2’ variable in the 2017-March 2020 NHANES dataset.\n\n7.2.1. Data summary\n\nanalysisE_data &lt;-readRDS('data/analysisE.rds')\nsummary(analysisE_data)\n\n       Race                 Education   \n Mexican :1008   less_9th_grade  : 628  \n Hispanic: 889   9_12th_grade    : 881  \n White   :2693   High_school     :1905  \n Black   :2337   Some_College    :2566  \n Asian   :1074   College_graduate:2021  \n\n\nFrom the summary statistics above we observed that there were more non-Hispanic white people than any other race in the dataset and the least represented group were other Hispanic. Notably, there were more people with a Some college degree followed by college graduates and there fewer people having a below 9th grade education.\n\nanalysisE_data |&gt;\ntabyl(Race,Education) |&gt;\nadorn_totals(\"row\") |&gt;\nadorn_percentages(\"row\") |&gt;\nadorn_pct_formatting() |&gt;\nadorn_ns(position = \"front\")%&gt;% kable()%&gt;%kable_styling()\n\n\n\n\nRace\nless_9th_grade\n9_12th_grade\nHigh_school\nSome_College\nCollege_graduate\n\n\n\n\nMexican\n266 (26.4%)\n170 (16.9%)\n230 (22.8%)\n250 (24.8%)\n92 (9.1%)\n\n\nHispanic\n182 (20.5%)\n133 (15.0%)\n182 (20.5%)\n245 (27.6%)\n147 (16.5%)\n\n\nWhite\n51 (1.9%)\n219 (8.1%)\n679 (25.2%)\n1,007 (37.4%)\n737 (27.4%)\n\n\nBlack\n52 (2.2%)\n289 (12.4%)\n672 (28.8%)\n875 (37.4%)\n449 (19.2%)\n\n\nAsian\n77 (7.2%)\n70 (6.5%)\n142 (13.2%)\n189 (17.6%)\n596 (55.5%)\n\n\nTotal\n628 (7.8%)\n881 (11.0%)\n1,905 (23.8%)\n2,566 (32.1%)\n2,021 (25.3%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was observed that Mexican American had the least education with at least 26.4% having 9th grade or below whereas Non-Hispanic Asians were the most educated with at least 55.5% of all Non-Hispanic Asian being a college graduate. This can be clearly visualized on the bar plot and the mosaic plots below.\n\n\n7.2.2. Visualization\n\n7.2.2.1 Bar plot\nI used the Bar graph to show the distribution of of education level frequency/count across the different races.\n\nggplot(analysisE_data, aes(x = Race, fill = Education))+\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Education level by Race/Ethnicity\",\n    x = \"Race\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    fill = \"Education level\"\n  )+\n  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"left\",\n        axis.title.y = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n        axis.text = element_text(face =\"bold\", size = 12),\n        axis.title.x = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, size = 14),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5,size = 12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2.2 Mosaic plot\n\n# Create a mosaic plot with `vcd::mosaic`\nmosaic(\n  ~ Race + Education, \n  data = as.data.frame(analysisE_data),\n  shade = TRUE,\n  labeling_args = list(\n    gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = 10),    # Increase cell label size\n    gp_varnames = gpar(fontsize = 10), # Increase axis labels size\n    gp_main = gpar(fontsize = 10)      # Increase title size\n  ),\n  main = \"Race vs Education Level\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.

Non-Hispanic Asians are under shown to be less represented at lower education levels suggesting they are less likely to fall into the lower education category whereas Mexican American and Other Hispanic groups vary, but with significant deviations in some education levels highlighting over-representation or underrepresentation.\n\n\n\n7.4. Conclusions\nThese findings suggest that there is a significant relationship between race/ethnicity and education levels, which supports for further exploration of the systemic or cultural factors driving these disparities."

BMI thresholds categorized participants as obese or non-obese, while education levels were stratified across racial groups.\n\nVisualization and Analysis:\nGender vs. BMI:\nBoxplots and density plots highlighted BMI distributions across genders. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed statistically significant differences between male and female BMI. Smoking and Obesity: Contingency tables were constructed for smoking status and obesity categories. A Chi-square test measured the association, with mosaic plots visualizing trends. Race and Education: A Chi-square test examined relationships between racial groups and educational attainment. Heatmaps of standardized residuals emphasized over- and under-representation in education levels across racial categories.\n\n\n\nKey Findings:\nSignificant gender differences in BMI were detected, with females having higher average BMI. No strong statistical association was found between smoking status and obesity. Racial disparities in education attainment were evident, with Non-Hispanic Asians being overrepresented in higher education.\n\n\nInteractive Dashboard: Bringing the Analyses to Life Purpose\nThe dashboard provides an interactive interface for exploring the results from Study 1 and Study 2, enabling stakeholders to visualize trends dynamically and tailor insights to their needs."
